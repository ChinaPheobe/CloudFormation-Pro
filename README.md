To create an AWS S3 bucket with Infrastructure as Code (IaC), use AWS CloudFormation. Write a YAML template to define the resources and their properties, then deploy it to create a CloudFormation stack. This approach automates the deployment process, ensuring consistency and reducing manual errors. After deployment, verify your S3 bucket in the AWS console or by checking your CloudFormation stack's resources. This automated setup is not only efficient but also scalable, making it ideal for managing AWS infrastructure. Using IaC, you can create, update, or replicate environments with ease. This makes it easier to manage resources, collaborate with others, and ensure a consistent infrastructure setup.
